## What is the FlySky SM100 Simulator Cable?
 
The FlySky SM100 Simulator Cable is a USB adapter that allows you to use your FlySky transmitter as a controller for flight simulators. It has a resolution of 1024 and supports FMS and VRC PRO simulators[^2^]. It weighs 28g and has a cable length of 1.5 meters[^2^]. It comes in black color and has a CE certification[^2^].
 
## How to Use the FlySky SM100 Simulator Cable?
 
To use the SM100 cable, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Plug the SM100 cable into your computer or tablet's USB port.
2. Plug the other end of the cable into your transmitter's trainer port. Make sure your transmitter is turned on and set to PPM mode.
3. Launch your preferred flight simulator software and calibrate your transmitter according to the instructions.
4. Enjoy flying your virtual RC aircraft with your real transmitter!

## What Simulators Can You Use with the FlySky SM100 Simulator Cable?
 
The SM100 cable supports FMS and VRC PRO simulators by default[^2^], but you can also use it with other simulators that recognize USB controllers, such as DRL, Lift Off, Velocidrone, and FPV Freerider[^3^]. However, you may need to adjust some settings or download additional drivers for some simulators. For example, for FPV Freerider, you need to download a driver called SmartPropoPlus[^1^].

## Conclusion
 
The FlySky SM100 Simulator Cable is a handy accessory for FlySky transmitter owners who want to practice their flying skills with a simulator. It is easy to use and compatible with many simulators. It is also affordable and durable. If you are looking for a simulator cable for your FlySky transmitter, you can consider getting the SM100 cable from Flying Tech[^3^] or Amazon[^1^]. Happy flying!

## What are FlySky Receivers?
 
FlySky receivers are devices that receive signals from FlySky transmitters and control the RC aircraft. They are compatible with different FlySky protocols, such as AFHDS, AFHDS 2A, and AFHDS 3. They have different channels, ranges, features, and sizes depending on the model and application. FlySky receivers are widely used by RC hobbyists for their reliability, performance, and affordability.
 
## How to Choose a FlySky Receiver?
 
To choose a FlySky receiver, you need to consider several factors, such as:

- The transmitter you are using. You need to make sure the receiver is compatible with your transmitter's protocol and frequency. For example, if you have a FlySky FS-i6X transmitter, you need a receiver that supports AFHDS 2A protocol and 2.4GHz frequency.
- The type of RC aircraft you are flying. You need to choose a receiver that suits your aircraft's size, weight, power, and functions. For example, if you are flying a mini quadcopter, you need a receiver that is small, light, and has low latency. If you are flying a large airplane, you need a receiver that has long range and high stability.
- The features you need. You need to decide what features you want from your receiver, such as telemetry, gyro stabilization, failsafe, diversity antenna, etc. For example, if you want to monitor your aircraft's battery voltage and RSSI, you need a receiver that has telemetry capability. If you want to improve your aircraft's stability and handling, you need a receiver that has gyro stabilization.

## What are Some Popular FlySky Receivers?
 
Some of the popular FlySky receivers are:

- FlySky FS-iA6B: This is a 6-channel receiver that supports AFHDS 2A protocol and has telemetry capability. It has dual antennas for better signal reception and PPM/i-Bus output for easy connection. It is suitable for RC airplanes and helicopters[^2^].
- FlySky FS-BS6: This is a 6-channel receiver that supports AFHDS 2A protocol and has gyro stabilization system. It has built-in ABS function for better braking performance and CVT function for smoother throttle response. It is suitable for RC cars and boats[^3^].
- FlySky FGr4S: This is a 4-channel receiver that supports AFHDS 3 protocol and has PWM/PPM/i-Bus output. It has built-in single antenna for reduced interference and weight. It is compatible with FlySky Noble FS-NB4 and PL18 transmitters[^1^].
