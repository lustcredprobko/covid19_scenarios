## How to play IGI 2 game like a pro?
 
IGI 2 is a challenging game that requires stealth, strategy and skills to complete its missions. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you play the game like a pro and enjoy it more. Here are some of them:
 
### Use the map and the binoculars
 
The map and the binoculars are your best friends in IGI 2. They can help you plan your route, spot enemies, objectives and items, and avoid unnecessary confrontations. You can access the map by pressing M and zoom in and out with the mouse wheel. You can use the binoculars by pressing B and adjust the zoom level with the mouse wheel. You can also mark enemies and items with the binoculars by pressing E.
 
### Choose your weapons wisely
 
IGI 2 offers a variety of weapons to choose from, but not all of them are suitable for every situation. You should always consider your mission objectives, your enemies and your environment before picking your weapons. For example, if you need to be stealthy, you should use silenced weapons like the SOCOM pistol or the MP5SD3 submachine gun. If you need to snipe enemies from a distance, you should use rifles like the M82A1 or the PSG-1. If you need to clear rooms or deal with multiple enemies, you should use shotguns like the SPAS-12 or assault rifles like the AK-47.
 
### Use cover and crouch
 
IGI 2 is not a game where you can run and gun your way through. You need to be careful and use cover and crouch to avoid enemy fire and detection. You can use walls, crates, barrels, vehicles and other objects as cover and peek around corners by pressing Q or E. You can also crouch by pressing C to reduce your visibility and improve your accuracy. Crouching behind cover can also help you heal faster if you are wounded.
 
### Save your game frequently
 
IGI 2 does not have an autosave feature, so you need to save your game manually by pressing F6. You should save your game frequently, especially before entering a new area, completing an objective or facing a tough enemy. This way, you can avoid repeating the whole mission if you die or fail. You can also load your game by pressing F7 if you want to try a different approach or correct a mistake.
 
### Watch some walkthrough videos
